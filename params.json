It contains several components:\r\n\r\n- The [student laboratory manual](http://bit.ly/t5-lab-student) and [instructor laboratory manual](http://bit.ly/t5-lab-instructor) hosted hosted on Google Docs.\r\n- The [instructions for the bioinformatic analysis](https://github.com/mikheyev/t5-lab/blob/master/Bioinformatics.md) can be found on the main GitHub page.\r\n- The VirtualBox virtual machine containing the data and software for this teaching module will be available on DataDryad. For the present, it can be dowloaded [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5275622/T5-lab.ova). \r\n\t- The data folders (reads, alignments and variant calles) are also [separately](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5275622/t5-data.tar)","google":"UA-45186360-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
