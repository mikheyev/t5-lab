{"name":"T5-lab","tagline":"Laboratory and bioinformatic teaching module using next-generation sequencing to investigate the outcome of experimental evolution.","body":"# Using experimental evolution and next-generation sequencing to teach bench and bioinformatic skills to the next generation of molecular ecologists\r\n\r\nThis is a module designed to simultaneously teach laboratory and bioinformatic skills. It contains several components:\r\n\r\n- The [student laboratory manual](http://bit.ly/t5-lab-student) and [instructor laboratory manual](http://bit.ly/t5-lab-instructor) hosted hosted on Google Docs.\r\n- The [instructions for the bioinformatic analysis](https://github.com/mikheyev/t5-lab/blob/master/Bioinformatics.md) can be found on the main GitHub page.\r\n- The VirtualBox virtual machine and data for this teaching module will be available on DataDryad. They can be found now on the [Ecology and Evolution Unit server](http://ecoevo.unit.oist.jp/class/t5-lab/)\r\n\t- Note, the VM already contains all of the data, so if you are downloading the VM, you don't need to download the data.","google":"UA-45186360-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
