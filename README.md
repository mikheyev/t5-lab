# Using experimental evolution and next-generation sequencing to teach bench and bioinformatic skills to the next generation of molecular ecologists

This is a module designed to simultaneously teach laboratory and bioinformatic skills. It contains several components:

- The [student laboratory manual](http://bit.ly/t5-lab-student) and [instructor laboratory manual](http://bit.ly/t5-lab-instructor) hosted hosted on Google Docs.
- The [instructions for the bioinformatic analysis](https://github.com/mikheyev/t5-lab/blob/master/Bioinformatics.md) can be found on the main GitHub page.
- The VirtualBox virtual machine containing the data and software for this teaching module will be available on DataDryad. For the present, it can be dowloaded [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5275622/T5-lab.ova). 
	- The data folders (reads, alignments and variant calles) are also [separately](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5275622/t5-data.tar)
