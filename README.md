# Using experimental evolution and next-generation sequencing to teach bench and bioinformatic skills to the next generation of molecular ecologists

This is a module designed to simultaneously teach laboratory and bioinformatic skills. It contains several components:

- The [student laboratory manual](http://bit.ly/t5-lab-student) and [instructor laboratory manual](http://bit.ly/t5-lab-instructor) hosted hosted on Google Docs.
- The [instructions for the bioinformatic analysis](t5-lab/blob/master/Bioinformatics.md) can be found on the main GitHub page.
- The virtual machine and data for this teaching module will be available on DataDryad. They can be found now on the [Ecology and Evolution Unit server](http://ecoevo.unit.oist.jp/class/t5-lab/)
